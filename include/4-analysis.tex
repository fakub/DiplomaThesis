\chapter{Analysis of the Attack against WBAES}
\label{chap:analysis}

In this chapter we present some remarks of the attack introduced in Section \ref{sec:unify} against Klinec's implementation \cite{klinec2013implementation} of WBAES by Chow et al.\ \cite{chow2002aes}, denoted as {\tt KlinecWBAES}. Based on our observations, we suggest blind attack (i.e.\ an attack without knowledge of the key) and mention some consequences in white-box design. % Then we outline why this attack is useful during white-box cipher design.
Finally we outline, justify and confirm an explanation of the attack.
