\chapter{Analysis of the Attack against WBAES}
\label{chap:analysis}

In this chapter we sum up some remarks of the attack against Klinec's implementation \cite{klinec2013implementation} of WBAES by Chow et al.\ \cite{chow2002aes}, suggest blind attack (i.e.\ without knowledge of the key) and mention some consequences in white-box design. Finally we present an attempt of a possible, however not confirmed, explanation of the attack.
