\chapter{Introduction to White-Box Cryptography}
\label{chap:intro}

Before we introduce the concept of white-box cryptography, we present some introductory topics of cryptography itself -- we especially formalize notions of security. Then we describe the Advanced Encryption Standard \cite{fips2001aes} and an attempt for its white-box variant \cite{chow2002aes}.
