\section{Attack Tools}
\label{sec:tools}

Since there was no open-source toolkit for the purpose of the DCA described in Section~\ref{sec:scawbc} at the time of writing\footnote{It was released in March 2016, see \cite{bos2016tools}. Bos et al.\ \cite{bos2015differential} published a link to this toolkit in their March 2016 revision.}, we implemented it ourselves. Our toolkit consists of several tools and subtools, see the following list.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Acquire traces (see Section~\ref{sec:tracq}):
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item acquire a single trace (PIN tools, modified versions of Teuwen's one \cite{teuwen2015movfuscator}),
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item memory reads/writes and their addresses/contents,
		\end{enumerate}
		\item manage trace acquisition (generate \& save respective plaintexts along).
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Filter traces (see Section~\ref{sec:filter}):
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item filter constant entries \& save its mask $M_C$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:constmask}),
		\item filter by address and temporal range,
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item acquire another {\em full} trace $T$ (preferably in the same terminal session),
			\item filter it with mask $M_C$, yielding $T_C$,
			\item visualize $T_C$,
			\item estimate address \& temporal range,
			\item create another mask $M_R$ based on the range using $T_C$,
			\item filter all traces with $M_R$ (see Remark~\ref{rem:rangemask}).
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Attack traces (see Section~\ref{sec:attack}):
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item run attack,
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item CPA attack (Algorithm~\ref{alg:cpa}), or
			\item bitwise DPA attack (Algorithm~\ref{alg:bitwisedpa}),
		\end{enumerate}
		\item process results,
		\item display results \& statistics.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
