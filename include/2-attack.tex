\chapter{Using Side-Channel Attack Tools}
\label{chap:attack}

In this chapter, we first describe an attack exploiting information leaks assumed in gray-box attack context (see Section~\ref{sec:bbtowb}). This attack is referred to as {\em Side-Channel Attack} (SCA) and we show two SCA algorithms, both practically usable.

Next we present a novel approach of Bos et al.\ \cite{bos2015differential} utilizing SCA tools in the white-box attack context.
