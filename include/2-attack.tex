\chapter{Using Side-Channel Attack Tools}
\label{chap:attack}

In this chapter we first describe an attack exploiting information leaks assumed in gray-box attack context (see Section \ref{sec:bbtowb} in Chapter \ref{chap:intro}). This attack is referred to as {\em Side-Channel Attack} (SCA) and we show two example SCA algorithms, both practically usable.

Next we present a groundbreaking approach of Bos et al. \cite{bos2015differential} utilizing side-channel attack tools in white-box attack context.
