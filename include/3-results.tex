\chapter{Practical Attack \& Results}
\label{chap:results}

Two implementations will be considered for the attack -- a naive AES implementation in C++ and Du≈°an Klinec's implementation of wbAES. The attack will perform as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item acquire memory traces,
	\item process memory traces,
	\item run DCA attack.
\end{enumerate}
In the following sections we describe these steps in detail, finally we present practical results of the attack.
