\section{Known Attacks}
\label{sec:known}

As stated in Section \ref{sec:catmouse}, soon after introduction of a new white-box implementation of a cipher somebody usually comes up with an effective attack. % e.g. ... \cite introduced in ... was successfuly attacked by ... in ... \cite

This is the case of WBAES introduced by Chow et al. \cite{chow2003aes} in 2002 as well, it was broken by Billet et al. \cite{billet2005cryptanalysis} two years later. The attack is called {\em BGE attack} -- it is an abbreviation of authors' names.

\subsection{BGE Attack}

BGE attack is a pure algebraic attack therefore requires access to all tables implementing WBAES. % Note that we might need to reverse-engineer binary code first in order to access the tables.

Note that white-box version of DES by Chow et al. \cite{chow2003des} 
%~ DES že Boneh et al. zlomil kvůli slabším okrajům, it did not take long time and wb-aes was broken as well. ... je v tomhle odolnej, ale existuje na něj BGE útok, Karroumi "vylepšil" nevylepšil
