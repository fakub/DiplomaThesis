\section{Using SCA Tools in White-Box Cryptography}
\label{sec:scawbc}

%~ Groundbreaking approach -- use SCA tools in WBC, even though there is no justification why it should work, it actually works. It is especially useful since it brings another and totally different way of attacking white-box crypto.

%~ bude o útoku Bos et al. z teoretickýho pohledu, high level popis, vč. toho jak vzniknul
%~ trace acquisition, trace filtering, row & address filtering (theoreticaly describe the whole attack)





%~ \section{Trace Acquisition}
%~ \label{sec:tracq}
%~ 
%~ First of all we need to acquire memory traces which can be done with tools like Valgrind \cite{nethercote2007valgrind} or Pin \cite{luk2005pin}. Both of them are open-source and both allow you to write your own tools.
%~ 
%~ We used Pin together with an existing memory tracing tool by Teuwen \cite{teuwen2015movfuscator}, we provide this tool on attached CD as well. See Appendix \ref{app:howto} for a detailed how-to.
%~ 
%~ \section{Trace Processing}
%~ \label{sec:trproc}
%~ 
%~ Once we have memory traces, we need to filter constant parts.
%~ 
%~ Display it, see 10 rounds, filter it.

%~ Use side-channel attack tools and press GO!
