\section{White-Box AES}
\label{sec:wbaes}

In this section we describe White-Box AES (WBAES) as introduced by Chow et al. \cite{chow2003white}. Note that it has already been broken by Billet et al. \cite{billet2005cryptanalysis}, see Section \ref{sec:known}.   %!% ref to subsection

The core idea of WBAES is based on usage of lookup tables as outlined in Section \ref{sec:aeslookup}, these are further improved in three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the key is hidden into tables by composition of consecutive steps into single table,
	\item tables are wrapped around by appropriately self-inverting random bijections,
	\item the boundary is extended into the containing application. \label{item:boundary}
\end{enumerate}
Note that Chow et al. introduced also White-Box DES \cite{chow2003des} but it has been broken by Jacob et al. \cite{jacob2003attacking} much earlier than WBAES because was lacking the feature \ref{item:boundary} from the previous list.
