\section{Trace Acquisition}

First of all we need to acquire {\em memory traces} which can be achieved using tools like Valgrind \cite{nethercote2007valgrind} or Pin \cite{luk2005pin}. Both of them are open-source and both allow you to write your own tools. I used Pin because there was an existing memory tracing tool by P. Teuwen \cite{teuwen2015movfuscator} and provide this tool on attached CD as well.
